    Calculates the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

    This is a placeholder function. The actual implementation will depend on the
    specific graph library and data structure used.

    Args:
        graph (Any): The graph object containing network topology and attributes.
                     The exact type will be determined by the chosen graph library
                     (e.g., NetworkX graph, igraph graph, OSMnx graph).
        start_node (Union[int, str]): The identifier of the starting node for the path.
        end_node (Union[int, str]): The identifier of the ending node for the path.

    Returns:
        gpd.GeoDataFrame: A GeoDataFrame containing one row with a LineString
                          representing the shortest path. The GeoDataFrame should
                          include attributes of the path, such as length, travel time, etc.
