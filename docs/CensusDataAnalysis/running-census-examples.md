### 7. Customizing Your Analysis

#### Parameter Modification
```python
# In Jupyter notebooks, modify these parameters:
GEOGRAPHY = "county"        # county, tract, block group
STATE = "06"               # California (FIPS code)
YEAR = 2022               # Analysis year
VARIABLES = [              # Census variables to analyze
    "B01003_001E",        # Total population
    "B19013_001E",        # Median household income
    "B25077_001E"         # Median home value
]
```

#### Geographic Customization
- **State selection**: Choose your state of interest
- **Geography level**: County, tract, or block group
- **Custom boundaries**: Upload your own geographic boundaries
- **Multi-state analysis**: Combine multiple states
- **Metropolitan areas**: Focus on specific urban regions

### 8. Working with Results

#### Understanding Output Files
```
results/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                 # Processed Census data
â”œâ”€â”€ maps/                 # Generated map visualizations
â”œâ”€â”€ charts/               # Statistical charts and graphs
â”œâ”€â”€ reports/              # Analysis reports and summaries
â””â”€â”€ exports/              # Data exports in various formats
```

#### Accessing Results from Windows
