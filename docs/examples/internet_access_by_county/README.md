# Example: Analyzing Internet Access by County in California (ACS 2022)

This example demonstrates how to load American Community Survey (ACS) data downloaded from the US Census Bureau API, combine it with county geometries, perform calculations, and visualize the results using `pymapgis`.

## Data Source

*   **ACS Data**: 2022 ACS 5-Year Estimates, Table B28002 (PRESENCE AND TYPES OF INTERNET SUBSCRIPTIONS IN HOUSEHOLD).
    *   Downloaded directly from the [US Census Bureau API](https://api.census.gov/data).
    *   File: `ca_county_internet_access_2022.json` (included in this directory).
    *   Variables used:
        *   `B28002_001E`: Total Households
        *   `B28002_002E`: Households with any internet subscription
        *   `B28002_004E`: Households with a broadband internet subscription (e.g., cable, fiber optic, DSL)
*   **Geospatial Data**: TIGER/Line Shapefiles for California counties (2022).
    *   Loaded dynamically using `pymapgis.read("tiger://county?year=2022&state=06")`.

## Files

*   `ca_county_internet_access_2022.json`: The raw ACS data for California counties.
*   `analyze_internet_access.py`: Python script to process the data and generate a map.
*   `ca_county_broadband_access_map.png`: Output map generated by the script.

## Running the Example

1.  Ensure you have `pymapgis` and its dependencies installed. If not, refer to the main project README for installation instructions.
    ```bash
    pip install pymapgis
    ```
2.  Navigate to this directory (`docs/examples/internet_access_by_county/`) in your terminal.
3.  Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python analyze_internet_access.py
    ```

## Output

The script will:
1.  Print descriptive statistics for the calculated internet access and broadband access percentages for California counties.
2.  Display a few sample rows of the data.
3.  Generate and save a choropleth map named `ca_county_broadband_access_map.png` in this directory, visualizing the percentage of households with broadband internet access by county.

This map will show variations in broadband access across different counties in California.
