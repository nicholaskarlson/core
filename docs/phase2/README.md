# PyMapGIS Phase 2 Documentation

This section provides documentation for the features and enhancements planned for PyMapGIS Phase 2 (v0.2).

Phase 2 focuses on improving cache management, introducing a plugin system, enhancing the CLI, and expanding documentation with practical cookbook examples.

## Key Features in Phase 2:

- **[Cache Management](./01_cache_management.md)**: Tools and APIs for managing the data cache effectively.
- **[Plugin System](./02_plugin_system.md)**: An extensible plugin architecture for drivers, algorithms, and visualization backends.
- **[Enhanced CLI](./03_enhanced_cli.md)**: New CLI commands like `pymapgis doctor` and improved plugin management.
- **[Documentation & Cookbook](./04_documentation_and_cookbook.md)**: Comprehensive documentation using MkDocs-Material and practical cookbook examples.

These documents aim to guide developers in implementing these features.
