# Phase 2: Documentation & Cookbook

This document outlines the plan for documentation and example cookbooks for PyMapGIS Phase 2.

## MkDocs-Material Setup

- Set up MkDocs-Material for generating the project documentation.
- Include a gallery of examples to showcase PyMapGIS capabilities. This could involve using something like `mkdocs-gallery`.

## Cookbook Examples

Create "Cookbook" style examples for common geospatial workflows. These should be detailed, step-by-step guides.
Initial cookbook examples to include:
- **Site Selection Analysis**: A tutorial on how to use PyMapGIS for identifying suitable locations based on multiple criteria.
- **Sentinel-2 NDVI Calculation**: A guide on fetching Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).
- **Isochrones Generation**: An example of how to generate isochrones (reachability maps) for a given location and travel mode.
