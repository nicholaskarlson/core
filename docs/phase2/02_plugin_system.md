# Phase 2: Plugin System

This document describes the plugin system to be implemented in PyMapGIS Phase 2.

## Plugin Registry

- Implement a plugin registry using Python entry points. This allows third-party packages to extend PyMapGIS functionality.

## Base Interfaces

Define base interfaces for the following extension points:
- `pymapgis.drivers`: For adding new data format drivers.
- `pymapgis.algorithms`: For adding new processing algorithms.
- `pymapgis.viz_backends`: For adding new visualization backends.

## Cookie-Cutter Templates

- Provide cookie-cutter templates to simplify the development of new plugins. These templates should include basic file structure, example code, and test setups.
