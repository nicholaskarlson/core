# Point Cloud Support

To broaden the scope of supported geospatial data types, Phase 3 will add support for point cloud data.

## Key Objectives:

*   **LAS/LAZ Data Support:** Implement reading and basic processing of point cloud data in LAS (LASer) and LAZ (compressed LAS) formats.
*   **PDAL Integration:** Leverage the PDAL (Point Data Abstraction Library) Python bindings for robust point cloud processing.
*   **Basic Operations:** Enable common point cloud operations such as filtering, tiling, and DEM generation.
*   **Visualization (Basic):** Explore options for basic 3D visualization of point clouds, potentially integrating with existing visualization backends.
