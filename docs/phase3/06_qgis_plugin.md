# QGIS Plugin

To make PyMapGIS functionalities accessible to a wider audience, including those who prefer a GUI-based workflow, Phase 3 includes the development of a QGIS plugin.

## Key Objectives:

*   **Core Functionality Exposure:** Expose key PyMapGIS processing functions and algorithms through the QGIS interface.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Design an intuitive user interface within QGIS for configuring and running PyMapGIS operations.
*   **Data Integration:** Ensure seamless integration with QGIS data layers (vector, raster).
*   **Processing Provider:** Implement the plugin as a QGIS Processing provider for easy integration into QGIS workflows and models.
*   **Documentation and Examples:** Provide clear documentation and examples for using the PyMapGIS QGIS plugin.
