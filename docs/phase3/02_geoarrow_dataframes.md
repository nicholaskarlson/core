# GeoArrow DataFrames

To improve performance and interoperability, Phase 3 includes plans to integrate GeoArrow.

## Key Objectives:

*   **Integrate `geoarrow-py`:** Once `geoarrow-py` reaches a mature state, it will be integrated into PyMapGIS.
*   **Efficient Data Interchange:** Leverage GeoArrow for efficient in-memory representation of geospatial vector data.
*   **Zero-Copy Slicing:** Enable zero-copy slicing and data access for improved performance in vector operations.
*   **Interoperability:** Enhance interoperability with other systems and libraries that support the Apache Arrow format.

## Examples

*   [GeoArrow DataFrames Example](../../examples/geoarrow_example/README.md)
