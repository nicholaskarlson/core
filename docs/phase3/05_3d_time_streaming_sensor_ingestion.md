# 3D & Time Streaming Sensor Ingestion

Phase 3 aims to incorporate capabilities for handling dynamic, multi-dimensional geospatial data, particularly from streaming sensors.

## Key Objectives:

*   **Spatio-Temporal Cubes:** Implement support for creating and analyzing spatio-temporal data cubes using `xarray`. This will allow for representing data with spatial dimensions (x, y, z) and a time dimension.
*   **deck.gl 3D Viewers:** Integrate `deck.gl` or similar libraries for advanced 3D visualization of spatio-temporal data.
*   **Kafka/MQTT Connectors:** Develop connectors for ingesting real-time data streams from sensor networks using protocols like Kafka or MQTT.
*   **Time Series Analysis:** Provide basic tools for time series analysis on the ingested sensor data.
