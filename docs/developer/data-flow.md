# ðŸŒŠ Data Flow

## Content Outline

This document will cover how data flows through PyMapGIS from input to output, including:

### 1. Data Ingestion Flow
- URL parsing and scheme detection
- Plugin selection and initialization
- Authentication and authorization
- Data source connection establishment

### 2. Data Reading Pipeline
- Format detection and validation
- Streaming vs. batch reading strategies
- Memory management during reading
- Error handling and recovery

### 3. Processing Pipeline
- Data validation and cleaning
- Coordinate system handling
- Geometry processing and validation
- Attribute processing and type conversion

### 4. Caching Integration
- Cache key generation
- Cache hit/miss decision flow
- Data serialization for caching
- Cache invalidation strategies

### 5. Operation Execution Flow
- Vector operation pipeline (clip, buffer, overlay, spatial_join)
- Raster operation pipeline (reproject, normalized_difference)
- Spatial indexing and optimization
- Parallel processing coordination

### 6. Visualization Pipeline
- Data preparation for visualization
- Style application and rendering
- Interactive map generation
- Export and serialization

### 7. Service Delivery Flow
- Web service request handling
- Tile generation pipeline
- Response formatting and delivery
- Performance optimization

### 8. Error Propagation
- Error detection and classification
- Error context preservation
- User-friendly error messages
- Recovery and fallback strategies

### 9. Performance Optimization Points
- Bottleneck identification
- Memory usage optimization
- I/O optimization strategies
- Parallel processing opportunities

### 10. Monitoring and Logging
- Performance metrics collection
- Operation logging and tracing
- Debug information capture
- User activity tracking
