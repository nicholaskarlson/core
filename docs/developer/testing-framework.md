# ðŸ§ª Testing Framework

## Content Outline

Comprehensive guide to PyMapGIS testing philosophy, tools, and practices:

### 1. Testing Philosophy
- Test-driven development approach
- Testing pyramid (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Quality assurance standards
- Continuous testing practices

### 2. Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function and class testing
- **Integration Tests**: Module interaction testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking and optimization
- **Regression Tests**: Preventing feature breakage

### 3. Testing Tools and Framework
- pytest configuration and usage
- Test fixtures and data management
- Mocking and stubbing strategies
- Coverage measurement and reporting
- Parallel test execution

### 4. Test Data Management
- Sample data creation and management
- Mock data source implementations
- Test data versioning and updates
- Large dataset testing strategies
- Geospatial test data best practices

### 5. Geospatial Testing Specifics
- Geometry comparison and validation
- Coordinate system testing
- Spatial operation verification
- Raster data testing approaches
- Visualization testing strategies

### 6. Performance Testing
- Benchmarking methodologies
- Performance regression detection
- Memory usage testing
- I/O performance measurement
- Scalability testing approaches

### 7. CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions configuration
- Automated test execution
- Test result reporting
- Coverage tracking
- Performance monitoring

### 8. Test Writing Guidelines
- Test naming conventions
- Test structure and organization
- Assertion best practices
- Error condition testing
- Documentation and comments

### 9. Debugging and Troubleshooting
- Test failure analysis
- Debugging techniques
- Test environment issues
- Flaky test management
- Performance bottleneck identification

### 10. Advanced Testing Topics
- Property-based testing
- Mutation testing
- Security testing
- Compatibility testing
- Load and stress testing
